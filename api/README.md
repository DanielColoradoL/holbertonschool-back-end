What Bash scripting should not be used for
Bash scripting is not ideal for complex, long-term projects or applications requiring high performance and scalability. While it's great for automating tasks, managing system configurations, and handling basic file operations, it's not suitable for building large-scale software due to limitations in error handling, debugging, and maintainability.

What is an API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

What is a REST API
A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of API that uses HTTP requests to perform operations on resources. It is based on a client-server architecture and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, typically using JSON or XML as the data format.

What are microservices
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is independently deployable and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices architecture promotes modularity, flexibility, and scalability in software development.

What is the CSV format
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line in a CSV file represents a record, and fields within each record are separated by commas or other delimiters.

What is the JSON format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.

Pythonic Package and module name style
Package and module names in Python should be lowercase, with underscores as necessary to improve readability. For example, my_module, my_package.

Pythonic Class name style
Class names in Python should follow the CapWords convention, also known as CamelCase, where each word in the name is capitalized without underscores separating them. For example, MyClass, MyClassWithLongName.

Pythonic Variable name style
Variable names in Python should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. For example, my_variable, my_long_variable.

Pythonic Function name style
Function names in Python should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. For example, my_function, calculate_average.

Pythonic Constant name style
Constant names in Python should be uppercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. For example, MAX_SIZE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT.

Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CapWords or CamelCase is a convention in Python for naming classes, which helps distinguish them from functions and variables. It makes code more readable and adheres to the PEP 8 style guide, enhancing consistency and maintainability in Python projects.
